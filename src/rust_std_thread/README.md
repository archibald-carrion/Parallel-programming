# Simple hello world using std::thread
> This example demonstrates how to create a simple thread in Rust using the [std::sthread](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/) module.

I wrote the code using wsl2 and build it using cargo. The code is a simple hello world program that creates a thread and prints a message from the main thread and the spawned thread.

## Usage
To compile and run the code, follow these steps:
```bash
cargo run
```
To delete the target directory and all generated files, run:
```bash
cargo clean
```
